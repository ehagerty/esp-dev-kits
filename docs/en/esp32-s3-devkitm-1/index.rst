ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1
==================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

.. note::

    As the ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1 development board offers essentially the same functionality and applications as ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8 and ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1U-N8R8, its production has been discontinued. Developers may use ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8 or ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1U-N8R8 for software and basic function testing (refer to :doc:`ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 User Guide <../esp32-s3-devkitc-1/index>`). This change does not affect the supply of the ESP32-S3-MINI-1/1U modules used on the board.

The ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1 is an entry-level development board equipped with either ESP32-S3-MINI-1 or ESP32-S3-MINI-1U, a module named for its small size. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® Low Energy functions.

Most of the I/O pins on the module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1 on a breadboard.
