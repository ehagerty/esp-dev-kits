:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

This user guide is intended to help you get started with the ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-2 and to provide more detailed technical information for development and integration.
The ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-2 is a development board based on the ESP32-C3-MINI-1 module, a general-purpose module featuring 4 MB of SPI flash. The board integrates full Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) connectivity, making it suitable for a wide range of IoT and embedded applications.

In addition to the ESP32-C3, the board integrates onboard sensors and a Li-Ion battery charging circuit, enabling portable and sensor-based applications without requiring external components.

Most I/O pins are routed to pin headers on both sides of the board, allowing easy access to the ESP32-C3 peripherals. Developers can connect external components using jumper wires or mount the ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-2 directly on a breadboard for rapid prototyping.

Power Supply Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:

- USB type-C port, default power supply
- 5V and GND pin headers
- BAT and GND pin headers (for single-cell lithium battery)

It is recommended to use the first option: USB type-C port.

.. note::

  The board operates at a 5 V power supply and requires a minimum current of 0.5 A. If your application demands a current exceeding 0.5 A, consider connecting the board via a powered USB hub to ensure stable operation.
