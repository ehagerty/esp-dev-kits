It is capable of up to 12 Mbps transfer speed (Note that this port does not support the faster 480 Mbps high-speed transfer mode). This port is used for power supply to the board, for flashing applications to the chip, for communication with the chip using USB protocols, as well as for JTAG debugging.
   * - Boot Button
     - Download button. Holding down **Boot** and then pressing **Reset** initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.
   * - Reset Button
     - Press this button to restart the system.
   * - USB Type-C to UART Port
     - Used for power supply to the board, flashing applications to the chip, as well as communication with the ESP32-C61 chip via the on-board USB-to-UART bridge.
   * - RGB LED
     - Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO8.
   * - J5
     - Used for current measurement. See details in Section :ref:`user-guide-c61-devkitc-1-v1-current`.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1
- USB-A to USB-C cable
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

.. note::

  Be sure to use a good quality USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.

Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please proceed to `ESP-IDF Get Started <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c61/get-started/index.html>`__, which will quickly help you set up the development environment then flash an application example onto your board.

.. ESP-AT Support
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. The ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 supports ESP-AT software that provides a set of AT commands with which you can quickly integrate wireless connectivity features into your product without a need for embedded application development of the module on this development board.

.. The software is available as a pre-built binary that can be downloaded from `ESP-AT repository <https://github.com/espressif/esp-at/tags>`_.

.. For more information about using ESP-AT, including information on how to customize pre-built binaries, please refer to `ESP-AT User Guide <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/>`_.

Contents and Packaging
----------------------

Retail orders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you order a few samples, each ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 comes in an individual package in either antistatic bag or any packaging depending on your retailer.

For retail orders, please go to https://www.espressif.com/en/company/contact/buy-a-sample.

Wholesale Orders

Power Supply Options
--------------------

There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:

- USB Type-C to UART Port and ESP32-C61 USB Type-C Port (either one or both), default power supply (recommended)
- 5V and GND pin headers
- 3V3 and GND pin headers

.. _user-guide-c61-devkitc-1-v1-current:

Current Measurement
-------------------

The J5 headers on ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 (see J5 in Figure :ref:`user-guide-c61-devkitc-1-v1-board-front`) can be used for measuring the current drawn by the ESP32-C61-WROOM-1 module:

- Remove the jumper: Power supply between the module and peripherals on the board is cut off. To measure the module's current, connect the board with an ammeter via J5 headers.
- Apply the jumper (factory default): Restore the board's normal functionality.

.. note::

  When using 3V3 and GND pin headers to power the board, please remove the J5 jumper, and connect an ammeter in series to the external circuit to measure the module's current.

Header Block
-------------

The two tables below provide the **Name** and **Function** of the pin headers on both sides of the board (J1 and J3). The pin header names are shown in Figure :ref:`user-guide-c61-devkitc-1-v1-board-front`. The numbering is the same as in the `ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 Schematic`_ (PDF).
